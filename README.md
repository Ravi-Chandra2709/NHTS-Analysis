# Uncovering Inequity in Travel in Florida

This is a data science project addressing transportation inequities among different income groups in Florida. 

## Overview
The analysis delves into the National Travel Household Survey data from 2001, 2009, and 2017 to understand the disparities in transportation access and costs faced by various income brackets. It aims to identify the root causes behind these disparities and propose potential interventions to alleviate transportation burdens, particularly on low-income individuals.

## Methodology
Utilizing statistical techniques, machine learning models, and feature importance analysis, this data science project explores:
- Imbalanced income distributions
- Factors influencing transportation mode choices
- Significant predictors of household income groups
- Impact of commute distances and transportation mode preferences
- Use of ANOVA, Random Forest Classifier, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for analysis

## Findings
Insights from the project highlight:
- Housing and transportation costs as substantial living expenses, especially for low-income households
- Relationship between work count, age, household size, and income groups
- Influence of urban sprawl and inadequate public transport on transportation mode preferences
- Importance of private vehicles due to geographical constraints in Florida
